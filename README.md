# SpaDDM: Integrating Spatial Multi-omics with Directional Graph Diffusion Models to Dissect Spatial Patterning and Signaling
Here, we present SpaDDM, a spatial multi-omics integration framework based on directional diffusion models (DDMs), which supports spatial pattern identification, cross-omics alignment, and inter-and intracellular signaling flow analysis.
