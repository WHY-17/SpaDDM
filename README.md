# SpaDDM
## Here, we present SpaDDM, a spatial multi-omics integration framework based on directional diffusion models (DDMs), which supports spatial pattern identification, cross-omics alignment, and inter-and intracellular signaling flow analysis. This repository contains code scripts for SpaDDM.
